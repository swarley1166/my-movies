Doug, Malik Yoba, Rawle D. Lewis","plot":"Derice Bannock a un rêve dans la vie : aller aux Jeux olympiques et faire aussi bien que son père, Ben Bannock, célèbre sprinteur jamaïcain et champion olympique du 200 mètres aux Jeux olympiques d'été de 1968 à Mexico. Pour cela, Derice s'entraîne dur tous les jours et peut compter sur le soutien de sa femme et de son ami de toujours, Sanka Coffie. Ce dernier est un bon vivant insouciant et sept fois champion de push car. Le jour des sélections sur 100 mètres, Derice est considéré comme le favori. Cependant, à mi-course, un concurrent nommé Junior Bevil, qui court contre l'avis de son père — un riche bourgeois de Kingston —, l'entraîne dans sa chute. Un troisième athlète est touché par cette chute : Yul Brenner. Malgré les réclamations de Derice, le président de la fédération jamaïcaine d'athlétisme refuse de faire recourir la course.","posterUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/510JX+xn2PL._AC_.jpg"}]
